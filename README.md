## Instruction

Because of unfamiliar with maven, after packaging the project, I failed to run the program(some dependencies like Google.Guava, Apache.common-lang3 didn't work after invoking), so I changed my mind, and pushed the dependencies into this project rather than let them handled by maven.

see the <code>target/</code> document and <code>cmd.sh</code>, and you will understand how to run the code.
