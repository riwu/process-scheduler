## Instruction

Because of unfamiliar with maven, after I packaged the project, I failed to run the code successfully(some dependency like Google.Guava, Apache.common-lang3 didn't worked after invoking), so I changed my mind, and push the dependency into this project rather than let it handled by maven.

see the target/ document and cmd.sh, and you will understand how to run the code.
